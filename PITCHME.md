Python supports integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers. They are defined as <i>int</i>, <i>float</i> and <i>complex</i> class in Python.

Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point. 5 is integer whereas 5.0 is a floating point number.

Complex numbers are written in the form, <i>x + yj</i>, where <i>x</i> is the real part and <i>y</i> is the imaginary part.

We can use the <i>type()</i> function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to and is <i>instance()</i> function to check if it belongs to a particular class.

 ###Syntax of Function
```python
def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)
---
##Above shown is a function definition which consists of following components.
<br>
1. Keyword <i><u>def</i></u> marks the start of function header.
<br>
2. A function name to uniquely identify it. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python.
<br>
3. Parameters (arguments) through which we pass values to a function. They are optional.
<br>
4. A colon (:) to mark the end of function header.
<br>
5. Optional documentation string (docstring) to describe what the function does.
<br>
6. One or more valid python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have same indentation level (usually 4 spaces).
<br>
7. An optional return statement to return a value from the function.

### Example of Function.
<br>
```python
def greet(name):
"""this function greets the person passed in as parameter"""
print("hello, " +  name + ". Good morning")
```
---

###Function Call

Once we have defined a function, we can call it from another function, program or even the Python prompt. To call a function we simply type the function name with appropriate parameters.
---

###Docstring

The first string after the function header is called the docstring and is short for documentation string. It is used to explain in brief, what a function does.
Although optional, documentation is a good programming practice. Unless you can remember what you had for dinner last week, always document your code.
In the previous example, we have a docstring immediately below the function header. We generally use triple quotes so that docstring can extend up to multiple lines. This string is available to us as __doc__ attribute of the function.
---
For example:
```python
print(greet.__doc__)
This function greets to
	the person passed into the name parameter.
```

###Scope and Lifetime of variables
Scope of a variable is the portion of a program where the variable is recognized. Parameters and variables defined inside a function is not visible from outside. Hence, they have a local scope.

Lifetime of a variable is the period throughout which the variable exits in the memory. The lifetime of variables inside a function is as long as the function executes.

They are destroyed once we return from the function. Hence, a function does not remember the value of a variable from its previous calls.

Here is an example to illustrate the scope of a variable inside a function.
---

```python
def my_func():
    x = 10
    print ("value inside function:",x)
x = 20
my_fun()
print ("value outside function:",x)
```

###Types of Functions

Basically, we can divide functions into the following two types:

    1. Built-in functions - Functions that are built into Python.
    2. User-defined functions - Functions defined by the users themselves.

---
###Built-in functions

	The Python interpreter has a number of functions that are always available for use. These functions are called built-in functions.
	Functions like print(), input(), range() etc. that we have been using, are some examples of the built-in functions.
	In Python 3.6 (latest version), there are 68 built-in functions. They are listed below alphabetically along with their brief description.
---

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Python abs() | returns absolute value of a number  |
| Python all() | returns true when all elements in iterable is true  |
| Python any() | Checks if any Element of an Iterable is True   |
| Python asci() | Returns String Containing Printable Representation   |
| Python bin() | converts integer to binary string  |
| Python bool() | Coverts a Value to Boolean   |
| Python bytearray() | returns array of given byte size |
| Python bytes() | returns immutable bytes object  |
| Python callable() | Checks if the Object is Callable  |
| Python chr() | Returns a Character (a string) from an Integer  |
| Python classmethod() | returns class method for given function  |
| Python compile() | Returns a Python code object   |
